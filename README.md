# will_compare_v2

An updated version of [will-compare](https://github.com/rosemadr/will-compare). A project to compare Shakespeare play texts.

## Why compare Shakespeare?
Shakespeare's plays are actually very variant. Many of the plays have mulitple source texts, sometimes including not only bound manuscripts but more "live" fragments of player's lines. Add to this that the plays are now over four hundred years old and have been editied, copied, translated, published and performed many times in those years and you find that "Shakespeare's play" is actually a rather textually unstable entitiy.
